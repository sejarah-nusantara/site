To keep track of the High Government&rsquo;s main decisions, in the early 18th century the Secretary General and his clerks began to select the principal decisions from the marginalia lists. They did so with the help of a list of more then 200 subjects or&nbsp;<em>Realia</em>. First they wrote their selection in a chronological list and then added subjects in the margins. The second step was to reproduce the list of selected marginalia in alphabetical order. The clerks produced annual Realia or subject indexes. It was a standard procedure to reformulate the marginalia as the clerks read through the marginalia lists. They always compared these texts with the original resolution text and then reformulated them. Every 3.5 or even every 10 years, the annual alphabetically organized Realia were compiled into a periodical Realia book. At the beginning of the 19th century, the archives of Batavia Castle contained more than 40 such periodical Realia books (both original and copies). These Realia books were frequently consulted in the 19th century and deteriorated over time. Between 1882 and 1886, the periodical Realia books were typed out and published in three volumes by the&nbsp;<em>Batavian Society for Arts and Sciences</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The Realia published in the 19th century have been a useful tool for historians for 125 years, but obviously they have their limitations. The selection of subjects is Company-centric, it is a contemporary 18th-century choice compounded by many errors in transcription. It only covers around 10 % of the marginalia registers in the Resolution and Besogne&nbsp; Books. Despite these limitations, the&nbsp;<em>Realia&nbsp;</em>have been digitized as a research tool. More marginalia lists from the General Resolution Books will be entered into the database in the course of the programme.&nbsp;</p>", "content_id": "<p><span>Ke-330 jilid Buku Surat-surat Keputusan Umum memuat versi akhir dari risalah pertemuan Pemerintah Agung di tahun 1613-1810. Buku Urusan Umum (Besogneboeken, 1743-1794) memuat keputusan-keputusan tentang pendirian kantor-kantor luar di Asia.

Mencatat semua daftar marginalia dari Buku-buku Keputusan Umum merupakan tugas yang sangat besar. Kesemua daftar itu terdiri dari sekitar 13.500 halaman folio yang berisi catatan dalam tulisan tangan.</p>\r\n<p>Persoalan seputar bagaimana mengakses daftar-daftar marginalia yang begitu panjang merupakan persoalan lama. Untuk merunut keputusan-keputusan umum Pemerintah Agung maka di awal abad ke-18, Sekretaris Jenderal bersama para keraninya mulai menyeleksi keputusan-keputusan pokok dari daftar marginalia. Mereka bekerja dengan bantuan sebuah daftar yang berisi 200 pokok permasalahan atau Realia. Mula pertama, mereka mencatat secara kronologis apa yang mereka seleksi ke dalam sebuah, kemudian mereka menambahkan subyek atau masalah di tepi halaman. Langkah kedua adalah menulis ulang daftar dari marginalia yang sudah diseleksi dan menyusunnya secara abjad. Para kerani menghasilkan Realia atau indeks masalah tahunan. Itu merupakan prosedur standar untuk merumus-ulang sementara para kerani membaca daftar marginalia. Mereka selalu membandingkan teks tersebut dengan teks surat keputusan asli lalu kemudian merumuskannya kembali. Setiap 3, 5 atau 10 tahun Realia yang diurut per abjad dihimpun menjadi Buku Realia secara berkala. Di awal abad ke-19, dalam arsip Kastil Batavia terdapat lebih dari 40 Buku Realia demikian (baik yang asli maupun salinannya). Buku-buku Realia tersebut sering dipakai sebagai rujukan di abad ke-19 dan sebab itu menjadi rusak sejalan dengan bergulirnya waktu. Antara 1882 dan 1886, buku-buku Realia berkala itu diketik kembali dan diterbitkan dalam tiga jilid oleh Batavian Society for Arts and Sciences</p>\r\n<p>Realia yang diterbitkan dalam abad ke-19 sudah berfungsi sebagai alat berguna untuk para sejarawan selama 125 tahun, namun nampaknya, ada juga keterbatasannya.

Padahal hanya terkait sekitar 10% dari daftar-daftar marginalia yang ada di Buku-buku Keputusan dan Buku Besogne.

Together, all lists add up to c. 13,500 folio pages of hand-written texts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The problem of how to access such long lists of marginalia is an old one. To keep track of the High Government&rsquo;s main decisions, in the early 18th century the Secretary General and his clerks began to select the principal decisions from the marginalia lists. They did so with the help of a list of more then 200 subjects or&nbsp;<em>Realia</em>. First they wrote their selection in a chronological list and then added subjects in the margins. The second step was to reproduce the list of selected marginalia in alphabetical order. The clerks produced annual Realia or subject indexes. It was a standard procedure to reformulate the marginalia as the clerks read through the marginalia lists. They always compared these texts with the original resolution text and then reformulated them. Every 3.5 or even every 10 years, the annual alphabetically organized Realia were compiled into a periodical Realia book. At the beginning of the 19th century, the archives of Batavia Castle contained more than 40 such periodical Realia books (both original and copies). These Realia books were frequently consulted in the 19th century and deteriorated over time. Between 1882 and 1886, the periodical Realia books were typed out and published in three volumes by the&nbsp;<em>Batavian Society for Arts and Sciences</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The Realia published in the 19th century have been a useful tool for historians for 125 years, but obviously they have their limitations. The selection of subjects is Company-centric, it is a contemporary 18th-century choice compounded by many errors in transcription. It only covers around 10 % of the marginalia registers in the Resolution and Besogne&nbsp; Books. Despite these limitations, the&nbsp;<em>Realia&nbsp;</em>have been digitized as a research tool. More marginalia lists from the General Resolution Books will be entered into the database in the course of the programme.&nbsp;</p>"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "dasa.basicpage", "fields": {"description": "", "title": "Home", "description_id": null, "image_description": "", "title_id": "Home", "title_en": "Home", "description_en": "", "slug": "/", "content": "<p>arsip nasional republik indonesia (anri) preserves 2,5 kilometers of early-modern archives 1600-1800. explore a selection of the main series online. browse over 150.000 entrances and discover thousands of references to persons and places, facts and events, and find what you need for your research.</p>", "content_id": "<p>Arsip Nasional Republik Indonesia (ANRI) melestarikan 2,5 kilometer lari Arsip Masa Awal Modern 1600-1800.
